# Ideas

- user needs to purchase a visa or a permanent citizenship.
- inside the dao, the citizens can claim daily (food, health care,insurance) stipends in form of Vot tokens
- there maybe a multiplier to distinguish between the citizen and a vista
- citizens have to periodically vote to allow new members that have purchased citizenship.
- when new members are allowed in, those who voted yes will share some rewards from the each of the new member's citizenship fee.
- for visitors with only visas, maybe they can only claim certain stipends and not all.
- citizens will be allowed to buy and sell assets to generate more revenue.
- assets will be limited to enorce some competition and incentivize trading.
- vot tokens are only claimed/minted through the daily stipends that every citizen receives.
- maybe add in presidents(trump,obama,biden) each with their own policies. 
- allow the members to periodically vote for the presidents.
- A president cannot go on for 3 consercative times in a row.
- each president will have their own policies. (biden could lower the stipend rate, trump could increase the daily stipend rates)
- each president should have a manifesto. the manifesto should be hidden during the voting and only revealed after the president has won.
- citizens should dictate the price of visa and citizenship, coz they will be getting 10% of the funds collected.
